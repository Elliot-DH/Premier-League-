## Project Description
This project aims to answer questions about the reationship between yellow cards, touches of the ball, interceptions and total points accumulated. The project answers these questions through data visulaisation solutions and calculating correlations. 

## Challenges Faced

Missing Data / Unavailable data leading to skewed results.

## Outcomes

Points and interceptions have a correlation coefficient on approximately 0.21 meaning they are not correlated. The conclusion I drew from this was that a high number of interceptions cannot be thought of as a marker for success.
The correlation coefficient was calculated at approximately 0.72 meaning the touches and points are highly positively correlated. I expected this to be the case, teams with more touches have more control of the ball and can therefore dictate the outcome of the game easier
Yellow cards and points accumulated are found to have a -0.3 - -0.55 correlation meaning they are weakly-moderately negatively correlated.
